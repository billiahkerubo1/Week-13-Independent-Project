# Week-13-Independent-Project

The analyses are on both supervised and unsupervised learning. The classification file is on supervised learning. A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ the services of a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

In order to work on the above problem, the steps needed are data cleanining and xploratory data analysis. The procedures followed are checking for missing values, duplicated values and checking for outliers. The exploratory analysis procedures followed are univariate and multivariate analysis. The univariate analysis procedures are checking the mean, median and mode. The bivariate procedures followed are checking for relationships between variables using scatterplots, correlation coefficients and linear regression model. The next step was classification. The described analyses and more machine learning procedures were done to determine whether a person would click on an ad or not. The machine learning algorithm used for the analysis was Naive Bayes algorithm, which achieved an accuracy of 95%.



The second file is on clustering. The procedures followed were loading data, data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. An unsupervised learning method was used in this context. The clustering algorithm used was k-means. The solution obtained was challenged by using hierarchical clustering. The visualizations on the clusters were also presented, as well as the classification using the table() function.




Setup Requirements: The analysis was done using R programming language
